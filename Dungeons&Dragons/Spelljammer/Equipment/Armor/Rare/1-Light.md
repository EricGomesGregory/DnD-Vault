### Nuwacna
Nuwacna at first seems like a oval shaped metallic gel... Once dawned the Nuwacna becomes a dark metallic formfitting suit 

#### Nuwacna
*Light armor (leather), rare* (Attunement)

***Attunement.*** This set of armor takes only one action to attune as it envelops your body quickly, forcibly removing any previous armor set that you were wearing. 
When unattuning from this item it takes one hour and you must succeed on three DC 00 Strength saving throws, taking 11 (2d10) Acid damage on a failed save, to doff the  Nuwacna.

***Symbiotic Relationship.*** While attuned to this armor you have the following features:
- Your AC is equal to 12 + your Dexterity modifier.
- Your Strength and Dexterity scores become 16 if they aren't already.
- You don't need to doff the armor set during long rests.
