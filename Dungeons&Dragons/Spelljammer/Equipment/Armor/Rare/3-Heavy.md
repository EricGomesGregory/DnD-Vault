#### Horse-plate Armor
*Heavy armor (plate), rare* (Attunement)

A set of utilitarian plate armor with light adornments that resemble horse armor. When transformed the suit of armor becomes a steel statue-like horse made of the armor's plates. 


***Attunement.*** You must be proficient in heavy armors and in riding horses to attune to this set of armor.

***Steel Ride.*** While attuned to this armor you can use a bonus action to magically transform the armor between two forms:
- *Horse Form* While wearing the armor, it doffs its self and transforms into a steel riding horse (a large construct with AC 18, 27 (5d10) hit points, and a movement speed of 60 ft). While the armor is in this form you AC is equal to 11 + your Dexterity modifier.
- *Armor Form* While riding the armor, it attaches its self to you creating a full set of plate armor around you.
