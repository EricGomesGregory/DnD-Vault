***Chameleon Carapace.***
You can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings. As a result, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

***Darkvision.***
Accustomed to caves, tunnels and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Secondary Arms.***
You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms function like your primary arms, with the following exceptions:
- You can use a secondary to wield a weapon that has the light property, but you can’t use a secondary arm to wield other kinds of weapons.
- You can’t wield a shield with a secondary arm.

***Telepathy.***
You have the magical ability to communicate mentally with any number of willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of you. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).

***Languages.***
You can speak, read, and write Kleek. You can't speak any other language.
