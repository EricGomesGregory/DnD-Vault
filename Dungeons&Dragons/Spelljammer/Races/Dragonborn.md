The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 3rd level, 4d6 at 6th level, 5d6 at 9th level, 6d6 at 12th level, 7d6 at 15th level, and 8d6 at 18th level.

You can use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain expended uses on a short or long rest.
