Weird West is a fantasy "wild west" setting for the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition role playing game.

## House Rules
The following are the house rules that...
### Hit Points & Luck
In this setting hit points represent your luck and your physical and mental ability to use it. As a result there are two alternative rules...
#### Spending Luck
On your turn you can spend a number of hit point, up to your level + your proficiency bonus, to increase the total of a ability check or saving throw.
#### Fragile Bodies
In this setting creatures are more fragile then the hero's of the standard Forgotten Realms setting and are more susceptible to ambushes and surprises.
 When a creature is unaware of danger and is hit with an attack, in addition to the  standard effects of the attack, the target takes 1 death save fail for melee attacks and 2 death save fails for ranged attacks. Critical hits cause an additional death save fail.

> ##### DM Note
> Non player characters  can have fewer or even more death save then the standard three, a recommended distribution of death save slots is as follows:
> 
>***Minions.*** are the lowest of the low, so 1 death save slot is more then enough.
>
>**Henchmen.** are the average or bellow average if compared to the players, so 2 death save slot is enough.
>
>***Rivals.*** are equals to the player characters in at least one characteristic and so 3 death save slots is right.
>
>***Elites.*** are creatures that are either at the pinnacle of humanoid performance or are slightly monstrous, regardless they can either have 4 death save slots or a feature that allows them to recover failed death saves.
>
>***Monsters.*** are creatures that surpass the natural laws and as a result can have more the 3 death save slots and in some occasions have features that allow them to recover failed death saves.
