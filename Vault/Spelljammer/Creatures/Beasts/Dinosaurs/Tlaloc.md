Tlaloc is a huge awakened spinosaurus with light brown scales...

He resides in a riverside temple where a tribe of lizardfolk reviers him as a god.

### History
Tlaloc once was a common spinosaurus but he awakened when he devoured **Stormstone** that awakened the spinosaurus consciousness and gave it dominion over lightning magic.

At first Tlaloc used its new powers to hunt in the rivers and lakes,  then it used to gain dominance over other spinosaurus, and finally when he entered in contact with TRIBE_NAME it learnt the language of the lizardfolk and became their protector and god.

Now Tlaloc resides in a riverside temple, built in his honor.
