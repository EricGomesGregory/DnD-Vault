If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to Slan's Charm for the next 24 hours.

The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 65 (10d10 + 10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a Long Rest. The target dies if this Effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0 and Slan regains a number of hit points equal to the damage delt.
