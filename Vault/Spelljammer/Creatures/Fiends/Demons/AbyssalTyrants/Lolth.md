	- She guided them to Dorchang.

Before Lolth was a abyssal tyrant, before se was even called Lolth, she was an aard woman known as AART_NAME.

She was a colonist on the world of WORLD_NAME from a powerful noble house from [Stuaghach](Ghrian#Stuaghach), as her years passed as a colonist she grew her influence with her quick wits and vorpal words, eventually rewarding her with the position of regent of WORLD_NAME.

AART_NAME ruled the colonies of WORLD_NAME for many decades with little to no issues and elevating the relatively jovial colony into a emerging power in the aard political sphere. This actions angered some of the regents of the other colonies...

As a consequence of the setup AARD_NAME was stripped of her role as a regent, her name, and was exiled from her house. In response she and a small group of alies declared war on AARD_GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT_NAME, starting a revolution.

Despite her few numbers their dedication and knowledge of their home world allowed them to outmaneuver the first armies sent to silence their rebellion. At first her war seemed to be going her way and the population started to aid her.

But her optimism quickly turned to despair when the armies of the AARD_GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT_NAME attacked with the might of their grand mages and began to destroy entire settlements with a single spell. The morale of her army quickly vanished and her end seemed near.

In this moment of despair she heard a voice in the darkness that taught her how to "bless" her army with powers beyond the mortal realm. This allowed her to regain some of her territory but it wasn't enough, so as her last orders she sent her retainers into exile and surrendered herself to the AARD_GLOBAL_GOVERNMENT_NAME.
