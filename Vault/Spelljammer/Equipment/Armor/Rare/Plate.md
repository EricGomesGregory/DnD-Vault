- *Horse Form* While wearing the armor, it doffs its self and transforms into a steel riding horse (with AC 18, 27 (5d10) hit points, and a movement speed of 60 ft). While the armor is in this form you AC is equal to 11 + your Dexterity modifier.
- *Armor Form* While riding the armor, it attaches its self to you creating a full set of plate armor around you.
