You can use a bonus action to conjure your chosen spirit on a unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to dismiss it. Whenever your channeled spirit is hit by an attack you take half of the damage...


### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.


### Focused Will
Starting at 2nd level, FLUFF.  This wellspring is represented by focus points, which allow you to activate powerful abilities of your channeled spirit.

***Focus Points.*** You have 2 focus points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Channeler table. You can never have more focus points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent focus points when you finish a long rest.


### Channeling Boon
At 3rd level, FLUFF. You gain one of the following features of your choice.


### Ability Score Increase
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
