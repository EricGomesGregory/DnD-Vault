Starting at 2nd level, fluff. You know a number of trickshots equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), whenever you finish a long rest you can change one trickshot you known.

##### Trickshot Options
The following are the descriptions of the trickshots available to the Gunslinger, regardless of subclass.

***Cauterize Wound.*** After making an attack with your firearm you can use the hot barrel to cauterize a wound of a creature within 5 feet of you, healing it by your trickshot dice + your Charisma modifier.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.


### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.


### Signature Trick
