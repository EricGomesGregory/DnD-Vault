***Speed.***

***Superior Darkvision.***
Accustomed to caves, tunnels and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Spore Cloud.***
As an action you can eject a cloud of poisonous spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the are must make on a Constitution saving throw taking 1d4 poison damage and being poisoned, or half as much on a successful save.

The DC for this feature is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The damage increases to 2d4 at 3rd level, 3d4 at 6th level, 4d4 at 9th level, 5d4 at 12th level, 6d4 at 15th level, and 7d4 at 18th level.

***Telepathy.***
You have the magical ability to communicate mentally with any number of willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of you. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).

***Languages.***
You can speak, read, and write Undercommon.
